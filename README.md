# Logic and Set Theory helper functions

## Manual: How to use

Version 1.0.0
Currently, this version can calculate equivalence classes, including equivalence classes on relations between two different sets, and on relations between powersets.
Cartesian product of two sets can be calculated.
Powerset of a set can be calculated.
Mappings can be defined with lambda functions, mapping tests can be done to check if a relation is a mapping, surjective, injective and/or bijective. Mappings can similarly be defined on two different sets and as functions between powersets. Images and sources of mappings can also be calculated for a given subdomain and subcodomain.
Finally, relations can be tested for reflexivity, symmetricity, transitivity and/or equivalence.

More detailed documentation is coming soon.
